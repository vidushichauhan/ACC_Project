Although taking your workout routine to the great outdoors is a great way to enjoy the fresh air and sunny conditions, the heat can take a toll on your body. If you’re someone who prefers to exercise in the sunshine, keep these eight tips in mind to stay healthy, safe and fit this summer. Wear moisture wicking clothes in light colors Light-weight moisture-wicking clothes in bright colours are ideal for working out in the heat. Light colours don’t absorb light; they reflect it, which helps you stay cool longer. For more information and tips on what to wear while working out check out this article! Split up your workouts Break up your longer workouts into shorter ones throughout the day. If it’s humid out, it’s probably best to shorten your workout to 10- or 15-minute segments. Timing is everything In the summer months, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is usually the hottest time of the day when the UV index is highest. If you’re planning on exercising outdoors, try to do it on either side of that time. Head indoors On days where there’s an excessive heat warning, it’s better to be safe than sorry. When you can’t beat the heat, there’s nothing wrong with exercising in a temperature-controlled gym or at home. Drink the right amount of water If you’re working out on a hot day, be sure to drink at least two litres of water throughout the day. A general rule of thumb is that you should consume 500 ml of water per hour of exercise. Once you’ve completed your workout, continue to drink 500 ml of water per hour for a few hours after you’ve finished exercising. One sip at a time Avoid taking big gulps or chugging your water. Instead, sip away on your water throughout the day, you’ll maximize the absorption of fluid, keeping your body hydrated longer.

Workout in the water Take up a water sport like paddle boarding, kayaking or swimming to stay cool. Know your limits Listen to your body. Symptoms of heat stroke include headache, dizziness, confusion and sunburn. The onset of these symptoms could be sudden or gradual, so if you are experiencing one or more of these symptoms, get out of the heat and drink lots of water. If symptoms persist or worsen seek medical attention immediately. Was this article helpful? Yes No Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.
