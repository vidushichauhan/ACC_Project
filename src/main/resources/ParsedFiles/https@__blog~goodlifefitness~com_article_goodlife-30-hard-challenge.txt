While the goal is to stick to the challenge for 30 days in a row, it's even more important to listen to your body. If you feel you need a break or need to skip a couple days, you can do that guilt-free and jump right back into it when you’re ready. The challenge: Follow a nutrition plan Whatever your diet preference (vegan, paleo, intuitive eating, etc.), follow it as closely as you can for 30 days straight. Allow yourself to follow the 80/20 rule. Try to eat healthy and nourishing foods 80% of the time and enjoy treats and more fun foods the remaining 20%. If you find yourself falling into a restrictive mindset, take a step back and focus on the goal - which is to fuel your body to feel its best. An all-or-nothing mindset can be harmful, make sure to take the pressure off yourself. Workout 3-5 days/week + 1 walk everyday Complete any workout of your choice 3-5 days a week for at least 20 minutes. The goal is to work up a sweat and get your body moving. Check out these workouts for some inspiration. In addition to your workout, take 1 mindful walk per day - taking time to think about nothing and enjoy the scenery. If you miss a day, don’t sweat it and just pick up where you left off. Drink 2-4 liters of water Hydration is key! You will start to notice a huge difference in your skin, energy levels and your hunger when you are sufficiently hydrated. Take progress photos Try to take progress photos once a week around the same time (preferably first thing in the morning) in the same outfit, and in the same place. You will appreciate the ability to see the difference when you look back on your month. One self-care task Perform one self-care task every day. This is totally individual and depends on what self-care means to you.
