Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, knife, cutting board, blender, box grater, salad bowl and tongs Instructions Chop the mini cucumbers and bell pepper into small bite-size pieces. Halve the cherry tomatoes and shred the cabbage and carrot. To make the dressing, combine the capers, chia seeds, garlic, hemp hearts, chives, nutritional yeast, green onion, dijon mustard, xylitol sweetener, juice of a lemon, rice vinegar, olive oil, water and sea salt and pepper to taste in a blender and purée until smooth. Set aside until ready to dress the salad. Place the baby kale in a large bowl and add the dressing, all of the chopped/shredded vegetables and the seeds. Mix well, serve and enjoy! Rate this recipe!
